TW3
===

The Window That Will Trounce Wookies
------------------------------------

OK, that's not really what TW3 stands for. Can you tell me what it does stand for?

TM3 is a game, played by two players at the same computer, or two players over a network,
that emulates - er, is inspired by - no, it just plain rips off - a classic "bookshelf" 
game I fondly recall from my yout (pronounced "yute").

This is version 2.0a - there are several things I'd like to do to bring it up to snuff.
See the GitHub bugtracker if you're interested or have something to add.
